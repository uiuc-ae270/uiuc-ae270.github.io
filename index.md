# Welcome!

This course will introduce basic techniques that underly many of the computational tools used in aerospace engineering and several other related fields. Here are some of the many exciting examples:



In this class, we will learn some of the key numerical methods that form the foundation of the vast majority of algorithms out there. Our aim will be to strike a balance between learning the mathematical underpinnings of these methods as well as how to implement them. That is, there will be a mix of analytical (pen and paper) work and some hands-on coding. 

We hope you enjoy your exploration into this beautiful and important subject!
