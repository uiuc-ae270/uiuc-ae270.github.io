# Assignment Submission Process

Assignments (homework/project) are distributed using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) and collected/graded using [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com). If you have never used GitHub, you'll need to [set up an account](#setting-up-a-github-account). Once you have a GitHub account, the general process for assignments is:

1. [Get](#get-the-assignment-repository-from-github-classroom) the assignment repository from GitHub Classroom.
1. [Clone or download](#clone-or-download-the-assignment-repository) the assignment repository from your GitHub account to whatever local machine you are using.
1. [Work](#work-on-the-assignment-locally) on the assignment locally. Ideally, you are commiting and pushing changes back to GitHub as you work (though we will not be checking this).
1. [Submit](#submit-the-assignment-on-gradescope) the assignment on Gradescope.

More details for each step are provided below.

## Setting up a GitHub account

Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and create a new account. You can use whatever username you'd like, though it is helpful for us if you use your Illinois Netid.

## Get the assignment repository from GitHub Classroom

Each assignment has a link provided on the [Schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule) page. Click the link to have an assignment repository created for you on GitHub.

Your repository will have your username appended to the end of the repository name (e.g., "hw1-python-refresher-username") and be located in your GitHub account within the GitHub organization for this course (e.g., "ae370-2022-fall").

## Clone or download the assignment repository

Using a web browser, go to the GitHub organization for this course and find the repository for your assignment. Click the "Code" button to clone or download the repository to your local machine.

See the [Common Commands]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/common-commands/#git) page for basic commands you can use to clone a repository using the command line.

## Work on the assignment locally

Complete the assignment.

See the [Common Commands]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/common-commands/#git) page for basic commands you can use to commit and push changes to your repository using the command line. Again, using Git is optional, but it is a helpful skill for you to have in the future.

## Submit the assignment on Gradescope

Save and submit your assignment (typically an `.ipynb` file) to Gradescope.
